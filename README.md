## About the project
This simple project on Python allows you to use linux-like commands in `cmd.exe` on Windows.
I made:
```sh
ls
touch
rm
rm -r
cat
pwd
mv
cp
clear
```

## Installation
Just run `py _setup.py` (The OS may require the administrative rights).

This will create the folder `C:\Users\<you>\.wcl`, containing the `.py` + `.cmd` files, and will add a reference to this folder in the `PATH` environment variable.
