### About the project
This simple project allows you to use linux-like commands in `cmd.exe` on Windows.
I made:
- ls
- touch
- rm
- rm -r
- cat
- pwd
- mv
- cp
- clear

### Installation
To install on your system you just have to run `py _build.py` and `py _setup.py`.
You can also use `_setup.exe` from the release with administrator rights.
